# DIALECTIFY-BACKEND
===

What is the purpose of this reposition?
---
> Dialectify is a PHP-based text cruncher. When I made it as a project for my Advanced Algorithm final project, I stumbled across a limitation: Crunching 12000 worth of text costs around 30 seconds on a normal computer, provided that it is written in PHP. Solutions can be provided with either of the following: (1) Creating a PHP extension, or (2) creating a processor in a more low-leveled language, such as C or C++. For this project, I will be focusing to make a console-based text processor in C.

Stay tuned...
